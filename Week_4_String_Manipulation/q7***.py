7. There are 10 vertical and horizontal squares on a plane. Each square
is painted blue and green. Blue represents the sea, and green
represents the land. When two green squares are in contact with the
top and bottom, or right and left, they are said to be ground. The area
created by only one green square is called "island". Write a Python
function to read the mass data and find the number of islands. Input:
A single data set is represented by 10 rows of 10 numbers
representing green squares as 1 and blue squares as zeros.
